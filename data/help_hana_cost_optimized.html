<h2>HANA Configuration for the Cost-Optimized Scenario</h2>
<p>
    This page defines the parameters specific for SAP HANA installations.
</p>
<h4>Production instance parameters</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Virtual IP Address</dt>
    <dd>
        is the IP address that the current SAP HANA primary instance has.
    </dd>
    <dt>Replication mode</dt>
    <dd>
        is the system replication mode between the two HANA systems. Please refer to the HANA Administration Guide for details.
    </dd>
    <dt>Prefer Site Takeover</dt>
    <dd>
        defines, if the secondary instance should take over, if the primary instance fails.
        If "false", prefer local restart of SAP HANA.
    </dd>
    <dt>Automatic Registration</dt>
        <dd>
            defines, if the former primary should be registered as the new secondary 
            after the takeover procedure.
        </dd>
    <dt>Perform backup</dt>
    <dd>
        defines, if the primary instance should create a backup before enabling system replication.
        If this is unchecked, it is assumed that the backup was already created manually.
        If backup is not created during this step, the Wizard will fail to register secondary HANA system.
        In order to perform initial backup, the Wizard needs to have a key in Secure User Storage. <br/>
        If you are configuring a multi-tenant HANA installation (default for HANA versions 
        2.0 SPS01 and above), please make sure that the secure store key is properly 
        configured for connecting to the <code>SystemDB</code>, i.e., specify port 
        <code>3&lt;SID&gt;13</code> in the environment settings and 
        <code>SystemDB</code> as the target database.
    </dd>
    <dt>Production system constraints...</dt>
    <dd>
        defines the HANA system constraints to be written into <code>global.ini</code>, such as the global allocation limit and column tables preload.
    </dd>
    <dt>Hook script...</dt>
    <dd>
        defines the parameters required for the failover hook script, such as the HANA user name and password, as well as the port number for SQL connections.
    </dd>
</dl>
<h4>Non-production instance parameters</h4>
<dl>
    <dt></dt>
</dl>
<p>
    <b>Note</b> that the wizard can only perform backup if the secure user store has been configured 
    prior to running the wizard.
