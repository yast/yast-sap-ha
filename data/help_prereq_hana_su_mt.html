<h3>HANA System Replication Scale Up: Multi-Tier</h3>
<p>Before proceeding with the installation, please make sure of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        There are two machines with SAP HANA installed.
        <br> Note that the machine you run the wizard on becomes the primary node in the cluster.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a firewall configured using the SAP HANA Firewall module in Administrator Settings, and <code>HANA_HIGH_AVAILABILITY</code> and
        <code>HANA_SYSTEM_REPLICATION</code> services are enabled on <i>all</i> relevant network interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
        You have created one of the following:
        <ul type="square">
            <li>
                A key in the HANA Secure User Store (using the <code>hdbuserstore</code> utility) on the primary HANA node.
                <br/> If you are configuring a multi-tenant HANA installation (default for HANA versions 2.0 SPS01 and above), please make sure that the secure store key is properly configured for connecting to the <code>SystemDB</code>, i.e., specify port <code>3&lt;SID&gt;13</code> in the environment settings and
                <code>SystemDB</code> as the target database.
            </li>
            <li>
                An initial HANA backup (of the <code>SystemDB</code> and all tenant databases, in an MDC setup) on the primary HANA node.
                Please note that if you prefer to perform backup manually on HANA 2.0, you should also make sure that the SSFS keys are the same on both HANA nodes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        When the Wizard is finished configuring the two-node cluster, make sure to register the third node for system replication like so:
        <br/>
        <code>hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=$(secondary_host_name)
            --remoteInstance=$(instance_number) --replicationMode=async 
            --name=$(site_name)</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
